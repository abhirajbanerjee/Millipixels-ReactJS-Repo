# Millipixels-ReactJS-Repo

##Approach
Created a reusable ContactDataRenderer component to display contacts with a search input.
Used React hooks (useState, useMemo) to manage state and filter contacts.
Contacts data is stored in separate Contacts.ts file.

##Assumptions
Contacts are predefined code(no backend/database is used)

##Running the App
To run the app locally, clone the github repo and then run the following commands to make it work:
npm install
npm start
